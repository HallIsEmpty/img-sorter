# FUWAN
## File Utility Without A Name

`vueapp` is... well, it's a vueapp.  for that you'll want to do `npm install`

to run the vueapp it's `vue serve` and to build it's `vue build`

now we'll make sure we have everything we need with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

After everything's built, you can start the flask server with `python3 main.py`

You'll type the name that you want to rename the files to, and then select the folder where your two subfolders are.
